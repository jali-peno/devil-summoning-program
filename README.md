Humanity is currently in grace danger!
Demons of legend from ages past have awakened from their long slumber
Soon, they will overrun the Earth!
In order to compete with the demons and fight for our survival, we will need to utilize their power.
Use this program correctly, and you should be able to!
I pray that those with the courage to use it will accept it...
To fight the demons that would destroy us, and to preserve humanity...

This repository serves as the codebase for a heavily overdeveloped but undoubtedly awesome demonic compendium for Shin Megami Tensei IV.
You will be able to sort through demons by affinities, levels, races, and view detailed pages about their stats and history.
